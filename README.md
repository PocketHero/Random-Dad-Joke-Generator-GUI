# Random-Dad-Joke-Generator-GUI-
This is a Python exercise that I decided to expand upon. It uses the request module to communicate with a website full of dad jokes and displays one of the user's choice at random. I thought, "why not make it a GUI?" And so I did! It worked out the way I hoped. Progrmming is magic.
